    <h2>Harry Mumford-Turner</h2>
    <p>I am studying an MSc in Advanced Computer Science, Creative Technology, I previously went to the University of Nottingham, where I helped run HackSoc, the Computer Science <a href="//hacksocnotts.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hacking society</a></p>

    <p>I love to <a href="//www.harrymt.com/blog/2016/05/18/sleep-tracking.html">track my sleep</a> and design websites for student <a href="//urn1350.net" target="_blank">radio station</a>. For my BSc dissertation I created an <a href="//github.com/harrymt/ProductivityMapping/" target="_blank">Android app</a> to reduce the distractions smartphone notifications present. I like to to look at other peoples CVs, so it is only fair you get to see mine. Here is mine that lists all the other things I have done, such as consulting for a Nottingham charity, working with Enactus and Quality Assurance testing for Barclaycard.</p>

    <p>Check me out on <a href="//github.com/harrymt">GitHub</a> and <a href="//stackoverflow.com/users/2235593/harry-mumford-turner">StackOverflow</a>, where I build projects and help people.</p>
